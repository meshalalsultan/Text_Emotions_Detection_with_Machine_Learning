Text Emotions Detection with Machine Learning


A human can express his emotions in any form, such as face, gestures, speech and text. The detection of text emotions is a content-based classification problem. In this article, I will take you through how to solve the problem of text emotions detection with machine learning using Python.

## Text Emotions Detection with Machine Learning

In machine learning, the detection of textual emotions is the problem of content-based classification, which is the task of natural language processing. Detecting a person’s emotions is a difficult task, but detecting the emotions using text written by a person is even more difficult as a human can express his emotions in any form.

Usually, emotions are expressed as joy, sadness, anger, surprise, hate, fear, etc. Recognizing this type of emotion from a text written by a person plays an important role in applications such as chatbots, customer support forum, customer reviews etc. In the section below, I will take you through a machine learning project on Text Emotions Detection using Python where I will build a machine learning model to classify the emotions of a text.

## Text Emotions Detection using Python
For detecting emotions from the text, I will perform a few steps that will start with preparing the data. Then the next step will be tokenization where the textual data will be converted into tokens and from these tokens, we have to identify the emotional words.

These emotional words will be the keyword to classify the emotions of a text. Next, we’ll frame this task in such a way that a text will be taken as an input and the emoji that represents the emotions in that text is generated as the output.
